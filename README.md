#### Questions 

+ what are basis function look like in 3d
    + simply 1d hat function in each spatial coordinate ? 
    + complications with using voxels (i.e. box/hexahedral)
        + virtual element methods ?
+ fem enforces natural boundary,
    + imagine 3d mesh, want to find displacement field
    + `u` fixed on feet, but free otherwise 
    + however fdm requires boundary known for the entire boundary, which seem to be impossible to do with fdm?
    + answer: always natural boundary with displacement at nodes not touching ground
        + one more unknown with one more equation 
        + taylor approximation with 3 poitns near boundary to approximate differnetail 
+ what are useful iterative methods (jacobi, conjugate gradient) to use
    + consider parallelism
    + where to look for resources
+ alternative idea
    + if 3d basis for polyhedra is hard to implement, 
        + why not just destruct each voxel into 6 tetrahedra, the local stiffness matrix would be same, 
        + simply need to compute local stiffness matrix 6 times, and populate sparse rhs
        + otherwise, matrix-free iterative method
+ time-wise possible?
    + 3d impl of fem?
    + multigrid?
    + gpu implementation?
    + just pick one!
+ boundary of voxel, model changes ? 
    + need more research on solving pde on voxels 
    + what happens at boundary
