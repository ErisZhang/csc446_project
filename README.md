## Problems 


+ global stiffness `K` is neither diagonally dominant nor has a spectral radius of <1 ...
+ how to do gaussian quadrature for matrix integrand?
+ how to correctly enforce dirichlet boundary 
    + set large value to `K_ii` for vertex `i` on boundary
    + set `K_ii` to 1 and `b_i` to 0 for  `i` on boundary, also removes entries `K_{ij},K_{ji}` for all `j`
    + lagrange multiplier
    + projection matrix to contain only unconstrained unknowns
+ convergence speed is slow for classical iterative methods
    + slow for large `A`
        + e^k <= \rho(A) ~ 1 - c/d^2 (nearly 1 for large d) for some constant `c` and `d` is dimension of matrix `A`
+ if cannot get preconditioning to work, work on small


what kind of experiments
+ linear solvers
    + backslash (ground truth)
    + gauss-seidel

#### Questions 

+ what are basis function look like in 3d
    + simply 1d hat function in each spatial coordinate ? 
    + complications with using voxels (i.e. box/hexahedral)
        + virtual element methods ?
+ fem enforces natural boundary,
    + imagine 3d mesh, want to find displacement field
    + `u` fixed on feet, but free otherwise 
    + however fdm requires boundary known for the entire boundary, which seem to be impossible to do with fdm?
    + answer: always natural boundary with displacement at nodes not touching ground
        + one more unknown with one more equation 
        + taylor approximation with 3 poitns near boundary to approximate differnetail 
+ what are useful iterative methods (jacobi, conjugate gradient) to use
    + consider parallelism
    + where to look for resources
+ alternative idea
    + if 3d basis for polyhedra is hard to implement, 
        + why not just destruct each voxel into 6 tetrahedra, the local stiffness matrix would be same, 
        + simply need to compute local stiffness matrix 6 times, and populate sparse rhs
        + otherwise, matrix-free iterative method
+ time-wise possible?
    + 3d impl of fem?
    + multigrid?
    + gpu implementation?
    + just pick one!
+ boundary of voxel, model changes ? 
    + need more research on solving pde on voxels 
    + what happens at boundary
